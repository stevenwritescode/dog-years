# Project Title

This app uses React.js to convert human years to dog years.

Contrary to popular belief, dogs do not age at a rate of 7 human years for each year in dog years.
    
- 15 human years equals the first year of a medium-sized dogâ€™s life.

- Year two for a dog equals about nine years for a human.

- And after that, each human year would be approximately five years for a dog.

## Getting Started
